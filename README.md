# Nostro Movie Website


This project is primarily focused on the backend development of the Nostro Movie website using the Spring Boot framework, while the frontend is developed using React. The backend is responsible for handling data, communication with the frontend, and database management.

## Introduction

- Nostro Movie website is a project aimed at showcasing movie information to users.

## Purpose

- The purpose of this project is primarily for learning backend development skills. It was created as part of a tutorial series on YouTube provided by freecodecamp.org.

## Development Focus

- As of now, the focus of development has been solely on the backend aspect of the project. Due to my ongoing learning journey, I have chosen to concentrate on backend technologies before diving into frontend frameworks like React. This decision allows me to grasp fundamental concepts thoroughly before moving on to more complex frontend development.

- In this project, I've learned how to connect the frontend to the backend and handle HTTP requests. Although there's currently no authentication or authorization features implemented, the backend provides endpoints to serve movie data and interact with the MongoDB database.

## Technologies Used
- Backend Framework: Spring Boot
- Frontend Framework: React
- Database: MongoDB
